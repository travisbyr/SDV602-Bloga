# Week 8

This week I learned about modules, object orientated programming and FileOpen dialogs.

### Modules

Python modules is a built in feature of the python interpreter that allows developers to add files/additional code to their applications. Modules consist of functions that can be called upon from another file/module. To utilise a module you need to 'import' it. Importing a module allows the current module to use the functions and variables that defined within the imported module.

To import a module simply add `import (filename)` at the top of the existing module. You may need to reference the file path as well if the module is not in the same directory, You can also import a specific function/variable within that module by instead adding ``import (func/var) from (module)``

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming layout use to easily navigate and reuse code. OOP is when properties and behaviors are built and structured in an object oriented way. Python uses objects to build the application, by compiling functions and methods into objects. Classes show this type of behavior as they create instances within a program where objects are performed. 

### FileOpen

FileOpen is a python module that provides users with document dialogs, where they can select directory's and files. The FileOpen dialogue then gets the directory and filename that the user selects. These dialogs can be used to get file save locations and specific files. Ill be using this module for my project as it will allow users to select CSV files to use as data. It will also allow me to get the directory of where a user wishes to save a merged CSV data file.
