<h1>Week 10</h1>

This week we focused on the 2nd milestone of our project. 

After reading the requirements I created a checklist that I will follow, which covers all the requirements for milestone 2.

- Review brief and add any changes made to our reports.
- Implement local data storage and retrieval functions.
- Implementing uploading, using and merging of CSV files.
- Display CSV file data in a graphical view.
- Implement an intuitive toolbar that users can use to assists them when viewing graphed data. 
- Users have the ability to display a different graph type of the data.
- A user can use multiple data explorer screens.

If I update my project to meet these guidelines then I should successfully pass the milestone 2 criteria.
