# Week 13

This week I learned how to implement a chat into my project using a thread. Here's what I learned:

### Python Threading

Threading is a feature in python that allows multiple tasks to execute at the same time requiring the same time to complete. By default python is single threading, meaning that a task is executed one at a time. Shown below is an example of this.

As you can see each a task is execute one at a time. Multiple threading will allow me to implement a chat system that is updated for everyone at the same time, using the same time. Shown below is an example of this.

To utilise multiple threads I will use the python library called Thread. This allows me to create multiple threads that will run tasks simultaneously from each other.
