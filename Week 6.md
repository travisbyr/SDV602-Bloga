# Week 6

This week I learned how to embed a matplotlib graph into tkinter. I also learnt about kwargs.

### Matplotlib Implementation

This week I was able to implement a matplotlib graph into tkinter. Below is the following code and outcome.

After learning how to implement the matplotlib graph with tkinter, I have a better understanding of how beneficial tkinter will be. As tkinter allows me to create custom elements, I now have the ability to create much more intuitive GUI's while using a matplotlib graph. 



#### Kwargs

Keyword arguments (kwargs) allow me to pass multiple arguments as one variable/argument to a function. Their are two keywords that make this possible:

*****args - This is a non keyword argument. This is for arguments that contain just a value. A code example is shown below.

******kwargs - This is a keyword argument. This is for arguments that have a key value pair  (e.g variable, first='one').  A code example is shown below.
