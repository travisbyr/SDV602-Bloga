This week was self guided learning, so I used this week to further improve my project. Here is what I did.

### Chat System

This week I implemented a chat system.

When the chat system retrieves the chat messages, the chat is updated for the user.

The chat system runs on a separate thread which allows me to continuously update the chat output for the user. When a user submits a chat text, the input as saved to the remote database.
