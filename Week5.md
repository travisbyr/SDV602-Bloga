# Week 5

This week we learned more about how to create graphical user interfaces in Python. 

### PySimpleGUI

This Python library allows users to create a basic GUI. This library offers a range of basic features that are really useful when creating simple user interfaces. When looking into it, I found it quite easy to understand. Originally I was going to use this to create a GUI but after researching other python libraries I might not. This is because I have found PySimpleGUI to be too basic for what I am looking for. It has a variety of features that I have found to be less customisable when compared Tkinter or Kivy. For this reason I'm going to do some further research.

### Tkinter

This Python library is similar to PySimpleGUI but is much more customisable. After learning about Tkinter I have found this library to be a lot more similar to C# windows forms, that I am already familiar with. I have also found that it s very easy to implement Matplotlib graphs, which is the graphing library that I will be using. The elements from this library are very similar to C# elements, almost identical and have a variety of customisation.

### Kivy

This Python library is different compared to the last two libraries. Kivy's main focus to to create a user interface that can be used on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Kivy has a wider range of intuitive features that make the application a lot easier to use. For example elements such as the buttons are created and styled similarly to what can be found on a mobile device. Because of Kivy's focus I have found that I cannot implement the same features from Matplotlib, when compared to the other libraries that I have mentioned. If I implement Matplotlib into Kivy the graphs are shown as a image and cannot have any interactions from the user. I am also unable to show the toolbar.

Because of this I will not be using Kivy.

**Decision**

Out of all the libraries that I researched, I decided to use Tkinter for my project. This is because of the features and easy implement of Matplotlib. I have also found this library very similar to C# which is a language that I am familiar with.

When comparing Python with Tkinter to previous programming languages I have learnt such as C# they are very similar. Tkinter is very similar to C# Windows forms, although Tkinter provides less functionality compared to C#.  If I had to chose whether to use C# Windows forms or Python to build an user interface I would choose C# Windows forms as it offers more features and can cope better with a larger scale project.
