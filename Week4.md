<h1>Week 4</h1>

This week I learnt how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. To achieve this I used a few Python libraries.



<h3>Matplotlb</h3>

I will be using this library to create a graph that displays my given dataset. This library no only provides the user with a graph, but the ability to view and pan the data in different ways.

Shown above is a screenshot of a basic graph. Underneath the graph are 7 buttons.

**Reset** - Resets the diagram back to the original view.

**Previous view** - Allows users to view the previous graph.

**Next view** - Allows users to view the next graph.

**Panning** - Allows users moving the graph.

**Zooming** - Allows users to zoom into and out of the graph.

**Configure subplots** - Changes the graph subplots

**Save** - Allows users to save the current view of the graph as a PNG photo.

<h3>PySimpleGUI</h3>

I will be using this library to create a user interface. By using this library along with Matplotlb I will create a really good user interface.

Shown above are elements that PySimpleGUI has to offer. Below is a test user interface I made.

PySimpleGUI is a really good tool that allows me to also convert XML to a python GUI. This is really useful as it makes GUI building easier in python. Although these libraries are not as good as web development or C#, they are fine to use for creating a basic GUI. Personally, I would not use Python to create user interfaces, although its a good tool for basic development.
