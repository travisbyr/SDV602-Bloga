# Week 14

This week was self guided learning, so I used this week to further improve my project. Here is what I did.

### Chat System

This week I introduced my login and registration system.





I did this by creating a separate GUI that would open when the application runs. This GUI would ask the user to enter their login details or to register an account.



If a user didnt have an account they could click register and create an account.



When a user enters their login details correctly, the application will provide the user will full access to all the data analysis tools.



To check whether a user exists in the remote data base, I am sending a URL query using the GET method to return a value that will tell the application whether the login is correct or not. If its incorrect, the application will not proceed further without the correct login details.
