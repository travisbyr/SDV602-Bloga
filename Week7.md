# Week 7

This week I learned about python File I/O.

### File I/O

Python filesystem (File I/O) is a built-in I/O library that allows you to upload, modify and remove files. Files that can be accessed range from images and text files. For my project I will be using File I/O to upload a .csv data file to my project, allowing users to create graphs and display information from this file. 

File I/O allows me to using .csv files with my project by producing string objects from the data. With these objects I can then view and modify them, allowing me to merge the changes with the original file.

Below is an example of filtering words from a document.



In my project I may use this only get certain fields of information. Filter will be very useful for my outcome.
