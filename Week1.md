## Week 1 - Journal

### What

This week we setup our devices to make sure we had the software to complete this course. As the course is covering python, we installed python extensions for visual studio code.

During this week we also covered programming paradigms and data sources. Here is what I learnt.

### Programming Paradigm

A programming paradigm is a programming approach to solving a problem. Each programming language is class as a type of programming paradigm. The following paradigms are programming paradigms.

<u>Imperative paradigm</u> - A programming paradigm that changes a programs state.

<u>Object-oriented paradigm</u> -  A programming paradigm based on an objects state.

<u>Functional paradigm</u> - A programming paradigm where programs are made by creating and applying functions.

<u>Logic paradigm</u> - A programming paradigm where statements show facts and rules about problems within a system.

There paradigms are important to learn about as they divide programming languages based on their purpose and functionality. This makes it easy to decide what programming language would suit a project best.
